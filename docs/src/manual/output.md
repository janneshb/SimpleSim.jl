# Simulation Output

If you run a simulation

```julia
data = simulate(my_model, T = T)
```

the object `data` will contain all relevant simulation output.

The output object mimics the structure of the respective model and can contain the following fields

* `model_id`
* `Δt`
* `tcs`
* `xcs`
* `ycs`
* `tds`
* `xds`
* `yds`
* `wds`
* `models`

The first two fields contain information about the model itself and should be self explanatory.
The fields `tcs`, `xcs` and `ycs` contain vectors or matrices that represent the simulation output generated by the `fc` and `yc` functions over the course of the simulation.
The same is true for the discrete-time system outputs `tds`, `xds`, `yds` and `wds`.

Output of submodels can be accessed via the `models` field. For example, if the top-level model has a continuous-time submodel called `my_submodel`, then its output can be accessed via `data.models.my_submodel.ycs`.
