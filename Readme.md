<b>SimpleSim.jl</b> is a light-weight simulation package for dynamical systems simulation, controller synthesis and testing and robotics.

Run `import Pkg; Pkg.add("SimpleSim")` from within your Julia environment to install `SimpleSim.jl`.

## Examples

Multiple demos in the `examples/` provide a rough but incomplete overview of what `SimpleSim.jl` can do.
